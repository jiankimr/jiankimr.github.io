  Developed EngEagle, a Chrome extension that streamlines English vocabulary acquisition during web browsing. Implemented instant word lookup and translation with automatic saving to a personal vocabulary list. Built a lightweight review/quiz flow to reinforce saved words with minimal context switching. Led the entire product cycle solo—from problem definition and MVP design to implementation and user-feedback iteration—ranking <strong>1st out of 25</strong> in a peer- and instructor- evaluated course showcase (SW·AI Business Application Design, CAS4151, 2025-2).
