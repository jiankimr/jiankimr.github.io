abstract: >-
  People often face distractions when using digital devices. To address this, we propose an AI assistant that infers user intentions, monitors alignment with them, and provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. In a three-week study with 22 participants, the system outperformed rule-based and passive baselines in helping users stay focused and aligned with their goals.
