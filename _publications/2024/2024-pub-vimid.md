abstract: >-
  This study introduces ViMiD, an OOD detection algorithm that combines Virtual Logit Matching and Mahalanobis Distance to improve performance in deep neural networks. ViMiD achieves strong AUROC results across datasets, showing the highest accuracy in distinguishing MNIST (5–9) from SVHN.
